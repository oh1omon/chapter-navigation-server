# Chapter Navigation Server

---

Important: It is not an API, just a cors-anywhere server

It is needed due to the cors policy of the source file needed on FE host.

---

To start:

-   npm start

To use:

-   Just append your link right after the end of the url of this server, like: http://127.0.0.1:8080/<https://your-link-here.com>

I am using Git Flow for organizing branches and VCS, and Standard Version for making changes to CHANGELOG.md and versions
